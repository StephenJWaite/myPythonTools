myPythonTools are a series of python functions that are used for various things in my PhD

--Anthony: A toolkit and script for project CT-Cine data onto 3D surfaces meshes. Anthony uses host mesh fitting to deform the surface mesh, and natural splines to create trajectory paths for openFOAM.

--ImageTools: A series of functions and scripts for interacting with CT data.

--Toby: Toby is a toolkit for using kinematic models to fit biological data, it is lovingly named after my PhD desk buddy Toby aka Toby Tank Engine.
